- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
Z-score Standardization – Handles outliers, but the data produced does not have the exact same scale , so when we use the zscore we will be focused on how to handel the outliers for example we can calculate the z-score of each person’s exam score.
Min-max Scaling – All features end up having the same scale, but it does not handle outliers well , so when we use the minmax scaling we will focused on All features for example image processing.
